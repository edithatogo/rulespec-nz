# Phase 0: Dependency Gate

- [x] [2153670] Confirm upstream issue #30 repo quality and CI scaffold is merged or locally reproducible.
- [x] [2153670] Confirm upstream issue #31 source-readiness manifests are available for this source family.
- [x] [2153670] Confirm upstream issue #32 oracle manifests are available for non-authoritative comparison.
- [x] [2153670] Confirm the shared income-base surfaces needed by Track 24 are defined or can be factored from current rules.

- [x] [2153670] Add the shared schedular-income bridge for withholding-style inputs.
- [x] [2153670] Add a combined shared-income bridge total for downstream consumers.
- [x] [2153670] Keep entitlement logic out of this track unless it is a shared primitive.

# Phase 4: Tests and Upstream Packaging

- [x] [2153670] Add companion `.test.yaml` fixtures.
