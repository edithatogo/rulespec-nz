# Project Plan - Track 4 Social Security Main Benefits

This plan is the active numbered Conductor surface for Social Security Act 2018 main-benefits ingestion and verification.

---

## Phase 1: Source Manifest and Existing RuleSpec Alignment

- [x] Task: Add source manifest regression test
  Write a failing repository test that requires an official-source manifest for Social Security Act 2018 main-benefit entitlement and rate schedules.
- [x] Task: Implement source manifest
  Add the manifest tying existing main-benefit RuleSpec modules to normalized PCO provision JSONL files, source-map batches, and comparison-oracle checks.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Source Manifest and Existing RuleSpec Alignment' (7427380)
  Verified on 2026-06-22 with `python -m ruff check tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py`, `python -m basedpyright tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py`, `python -m pytest tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py -p no:cacheprovider`, and `python -m pytest tests -p no:cacheprovider`.

## Phase 2: Remaining Main-Benefit Coverage Trace

- [x] Task: Inventory remaining main-benefit surfaces (fa4fea4)
  Identify Emergency Benefit, Youth Payment, Young Parent Payment, Orphan's Benefit, Unsupported Child's Benefit, asset tests, and stand-down provisions still outside the first modules.
- [x] Task: Add coverage-gap assertions (fa4fea4)
  Test that the Track 4 manifest records implemented and deferred main-benefit surfaces explicitly.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Remaining Main-Benefit Coverage Trace' (fa4fea4)
  Verified on 2026-06-22 with `python -m ruff check tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py`, `python -m basedpyright tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py`, `python -m pytest tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py -p no:cacheprovider`, and `python -m pytest tests -p no:cacheprovider`.

---

## Phase 3: Oracle Fixture Cross-Check

- [x] Task: Add main-benefit oracle fixtures (43f5d23)
  Extract minimal pinned fixtures for Jobseeker, Sole Parent Support, and Supported Living Payment from comparison oracles.
- [x] Task: Compare fixtures against RuleSpec values (43f5d23)
  Add tests proving oracle fixtures align with official-source-backed RuleSpec values without treating oracles as legal authority.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Oracle Fixture Cross-Check' (43f5d23)
  Verified on 2026-06-22 with `python -m ruff check tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py`, `python -m basedpyright tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py`, `python -m pytest tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py -p no:cacheprovider`, and `python -m pytest tests -p no:cacheprovider`.

## Review and Archive Note

- 2026-06-23 Conductor review outcome: archived after clean review.
- Passing gates rerun during review:
  - `python -m pytest tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py -q -p no:cacheprovider`
  - `python -m ruff check tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py`
  - `python -m basedpyright tests\test_social_security_main_benefits_manifest.py`
  - `python -m pytest tests\test_repository_layout.py -q -p no:cacheprovider`
- Residual risk: no live PCO re-download was performed; review is based on committed normalized provision extracts and manifest evidence.
