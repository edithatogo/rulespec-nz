# Track Plan: OpenFisca Parsing & Transpilation Adapter

This plan implements Track 2 to build a guarded OpenFisca reference parser and future transpilation adapter.

---

## Phase 1: Guarded Oracle Reference Intake

- [x] Task: Scaffold OpenFisca oracle reference parser (7eb1ba0)
  Parse `data/oracles/oracle-index.json` and `data/coverage/tax-benefit-source-map.json` to produce comparison-only OpenFisca reference manifests with pinned commits and `canonical_law: false` guardrails.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Guarded Oracle Reference Intake' (f9faa2d)
  Verified on 2026-06-21 with `python -m ruff check tests\test_openfisca_adapter.py programs\nz\openfisca_adapter.py`, `python -m basedpyright tests\test_openfisca_adapter.py programs\nz\openfisca_adapter.py`, `python -m pytest tests\test_openfisca_adapter.py -p no:cacheprovider`, and `python -m pytest tests -p no:cacheprovider`.

---

## Phase 2: Fixture Extraction Contracts

- [x] Task: Define OpenFisca fixture extraction schema (93a4cb6)
  Added a guarded fixture extraction schema to the OpenFisca reference manifest, covering allowed source kinds, required normalized candidate fields, pinned source commit, non-authoritative guardrails, and promoted output boundaries.
- [x] Task: Implement fixture extraction dry-run (be3434a)
  Added an in-memory dry-run normalizer that reads selected OpenFisca-style parameter and test snippets and emits guarded fixture candidates with pinned source commits, RuleSpec destinations, inputs, expected outputs, and `canonical_law: false`.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Fixture Extraction Contracts' (Protocol in workflow.md) (c8a85ea)
  Verified on 2026-06-22 with `python -m ruff check tests\test_openfisca_adapter.py programs\nz\openfisca_adapter.py`, `python -m basedpyright tests\test_openfisca_adapter.py programs\nz\openfisca_adapter.py`, `python -m pytest tests\test_openfisca_adapter.py -p no:cacheprovider`, and `python -m pytest tests -p no:cacheprovider`.

### Review Remediation Commits

- `e2f78a8` - Propagated pinned OpenFisca commits and RuleSpec destinations onto each track-level OpenFisca reference after Track 2 review.

## Review and Archive Note

- 2026-06-23 Conductor review outcome: archived after remediating missing Phase 2 verification commit bookkeeping.
- Passing gates rerun during review:
  - `python -m pytest tests\test_openfisca_adapter.py -q -p no:cacheprovider`
  - `python -m ruff check tests\test_openfisca_adapter.py programs\nz\openfisca_adapter.py`
  - `python -m basedpyright tests\test_openfisca_adapter.py programs\nz\openfisca_adapter.py`
- Residual risk: the adapter intentionally emits future RuleSpec destinations from `data/coverage/tax-benefit-source-map.json`; some destinations are documented consolidation targets rather than existing module paths.
